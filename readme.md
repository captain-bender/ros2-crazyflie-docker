# ROS 2 Crazyflie docker

This is an image that I generated using the workflow that is suggested by Kimberly McGuire in the [Crazyflieâ€™s Adventures with ROS 2 and Gazebo](https://www.bitcraze.io/2024/09/crazyflies-adventures-with-ros-2-and-gazebo/).

I had to change some conflicts between libignition-gazebo and gz-sim plugins, but other than that it works as expected.

To build the image, you need to type:
```$
docker build --no-cache -t ros2-crazyflie .
```

To run the container, you need to type:
```$
docker run -it --rm --network=host --ipc=host -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw --env=DISPLAY --name ros2-crazyflie-container ros2-crazyflie
```

It was testes in an Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS machine
